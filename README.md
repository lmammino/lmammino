# 👋 Hello, this is Luciano!

I wrote my first line of code at the age of 12 on my father's old i386 👨‍💻. Since then, I never stopped coding. I am currently working at [fourTheorem](https://www.fourtheorem.com/?utm_source=github-lmammino) as Senior Architect where I am helping companies to take advantage of the **serverless** paradigm (if you or your company are interested in that [talk to us](https://www.fourtheorem.com/contact?utm_source=github-lmammino)).

I am the co-author of [Node.js Design Patterns](https://www.nodejsdesignpatterns.com) and I run [Fullstack Bulletin](https://fstack.link), a free weekly newsletter for fullstack developers.
