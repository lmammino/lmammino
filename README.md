# 👋 Hello, this is Luciano!

I wrote my first line of code at the age of 12 on my father's old i386 👨‍💻. Since then, I never stopped coding. I am currently working at  FabFitFun as Principal Software Engineer where I am building microservices to serve millions of users every day.

I am the co-author of [Node.js Design Patterns](https://amzn.to/2ZQnpZS) and I run [Fullstack Bulletin](fstack.link), a free weekly newsletter for fullstack developers.
